AutoHotKey_M

This project is a Windows DLL loosely based on AutoHotKey and its variants.  It has one major difference from AutoHotKey_L or even AutoHotKey_H: it's not a language.  I'm doing it this way because what AHK does well is automation and hotkeys (the original developer named it well lol).  But it adds to this amazing API a bunch of other stuff that other languages can already do, and some do better (GUIs, strings, COM interop, math(s), stuff like that).  And don't get me started on its syntax.

The reason I'm doing this is because in the projects I'm doing (both at home and at work) it would be really nice to have access to AHK's functionality, without this mixed-up little language that few developers have ever heard of and even fewer know how to use. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to be able to throw together a little GUI in 3 lines of code, and I'll take AHK's ComObjCreate over the complicated crap involved in doing it from C++.  But compare AHK's community to C#, Python, or any "real" language, and there's no comparison; frameworks and libraries and sites like NuGet vs. a "scripts and functions" section of a forum... just sayin lol.  And I'm clearly not the only one interested in moving AHK this way (just check the "other programming languages" section of the forum).

## License

I'm gonna have to Google AHK's license, and put that here.  Personally I would WTFPL everything, but since this is based off someone else's work we gotta respect their license.  I'll have that info up soon.

## Documentation

Once I have enough code to write documentation, I'll be writing it on my website.
